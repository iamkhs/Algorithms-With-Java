    Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that
    compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them
    until they are in the intended order.
    Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water
    that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to the end in each iteration.
    Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.
    This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as
    its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.
